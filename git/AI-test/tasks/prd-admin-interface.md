# Admin Interface for Portfolio – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction/Overview
The goal is to add an admin interface to the portfolio website, accessible only to the site owner (Chelsea). This interface will allow for adding, editing, and deleting project entries, with a user-friendly form organized by sections, support for dynamic arrays, file uploads with image preview, and robust form validation. The admin interface will be accessible via a hidden route and require authentication.

## 2. Goals
- Enable the site owner to manage (add, edit, delete) project data through a secure admin interface.
- Organize form fields by logical sections for clarity and ease of use.
- Support dynamic arrays for fields such as technologies, images, or collaborators.
- Allow file uploads (.jpg, .png, .svg, .gif) with image preview.
- Provide form validation (required/optional fields, max length, file size/type limits, etc.).
- Ensure the interface is accessible only after authentication.
- Store project data in a local JSON file (for now).

## 3. User Stories
- As the site owner, I want to log in to the admin interface so that only I can manage my portfolio projects.
- As the site owner, I want to add a new project with all relevant details, including images and dynamic lists.
- As the site owner, I want to edit existing projects and update their information.
- As the site owner, I want to delete a project, but only after a strong confirmation to prevent mistakes.
- As the site owner, I want to see a preview of images I upload before saving.
- As the site owner, I want the form to be organized and easy to use, even for complex project data.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The admin interface must be accessible via a hidden route (e.g., `/admin`).
2. The admin interface must require authentication (e.g., password login) before access is granted.
3. The interface must provide a form for adding new projects, organized by logical sections (e.g., General Info, Technologies, Images, Collaborators, etc.).
4. The form must support dynamic arrays (e.g., add/remove technologies, images, collaborators).
5. The form must support file uploads for images (.jpg, .png, .svg, .gif) with an immediate preview after selection.
6. The form must include both required and optional fields (placeholders for now).
7. The form must include basic validation (required fields, max length, file type/size limits, etc. – placeholders for now).
8. The interface must allow editing of existing projects, pre-filling the form with current data.
9. The interface must allow deleting projects, with a strong confirmation dialog.
10. All project data must be saved to a local JSON file (for now).
11. The interface should be visually organized and easy to use.
12. (Optional/Nice-to-have) Support search/filter and undo changes.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- No multi-user support or role-based permissions (only the site owner will use it).
- No backend/database integration at this stage (may be added later).
- No public access to the admin interface.
- No advanced image editing or cloud storage integration at this stage.

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)
- Use a modern, clean UI with clear sectioning (tabs, accordions, or cards as appropriate).
- Use a modal or page for delete confirmation.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
- Use best practices for form usability and accessibility.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)
- Authentication can be a simple password form (stored securely in environment or config).
- Use React state for form management; consider a form library (Formik, React Hook Form, etc.).
- Use localStorage or a local JSON file for data persistence (for now).
- File uploads can be handled in-memory or saved to a local folder (if supported by the hosting environment).
- Image preview can use FileReader API.

## 8. Success Metrics
- The site owner can successfully add, edit, and delete projects via the admin interface.
- All form validation works as expected.
- Uploaded images preview correctly.
- No unauthorized access to the admin interface.
- Data persists correctly in the local JSON file.

## 9. Open Questions
- What is the final list of fields/sections for each project? (To be provided by the user.)
- Which fields should support dynamic arrays? (To be confirmed.)
- What are the exact validation rules for each field? (To be defined.)
- Should file uploads be stored locally or integrated with a cloud service in the future?
- What authentication method is preferred (password, OAuth, etc.)?
- Should there be an audit log or undo feature?
